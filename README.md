This is the anlysis of the sampling for predicating lending for mortgages. 

Resampling
The analysis of this credit risk resampling limiting the defualt of false negatives. With the resampling accuracy, the combination has higher recall than the other model.
The model The best model to measure this from Bootstrapping. It will be good option because Bootstrap randomly draws samples, having multiple occurances in the same sample. 


Ensemble
It is grouping together the model with high accuracy and recall in the AdaBoost model 
Adaptiveboost model has accuracy and high recall. Finding the best predictability with the highest accuracy by having more true positives.
